* ulisp-wasm
This is a port of ulisp to bare metal WASM - in which all imports are forbidden, and the code is invoked only by the runtime.

* Building
ulisp-wasm is built in sandbox mode by default (suitable for a situation in which all imports are indeed forbidden).
The command
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make run
#+END_SRC
will build ulisp-wasm and invoke the function 'init()' using wasmer.

Building ulisp-wasm in non-sandboxed mode, however, allows one to communicate with it in the terminal, which may aid in development, testing and debugging.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make clean && SANDBOX=0 make run
#+END_SRC
will build and run the non-sandboxed mode using wasmer.

* Status
lgtm (looks good to me).

* Future work
The non-sandboxed mode would benefit from using kripken's method of simulating non local jumps with asyncify.
This would allow for proper error handling other than just quitting.
Of course, error handling is not possible at all in sandboxed mode.
