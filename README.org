* ulisp-wasm
This is a port of ulisp to bare metal WASM - in which all imports are forbidden, and the code is invoked only by the runtime.
It is just over 200kB in size.
* Building
ulisp-wasm is built in sandbox mode by default (suitable for a situation in which all imports are indeed forbidden).
The command
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make run
#+END_SRC
will build ulisp-wasm and invoke the function 'init()' using wasmer.

Building ulisp-wasm in non-sandboxed mode, however, allows one to communicate with it in the terminal, which may aid in development, testing and debugging.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make clean && SANDBOX=0 make run
#+END_SRC
will build and run the non-sandboxed mode using wasmer.

* Status
lgtm (looks good to me).

* Future work
Figure out how to have more than one longjmp.
Make error messages better.
