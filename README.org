* ulisp-wasm
This is a port of ulisp to bare metal WASM.

Not even the C standard library may be assumed to be present on the target platform.

* Status
lgtm (looks good to me)
* Issues/ future work
At the moment /all/ imports are stubbed out, which means no I/O.
On arduino, ulisp communicates through a serial interface, allowing for a REPL.
In future, it would be nice to have an option to build with just enough WASI support to allow for input/output, as in [[https://github.com/kripken/talks/blob/master/jmp.c]].
This would allow for interactive development and testing with e.g. wasmer, while the deployment platform has all input and output stubbed out.
The amount of work needed is not excessive: the commented out I/O calls need to be put back in, and calls to the serial interface needs to be adapted to use WASI.
